Although major advances\\nhave been made in the field, one recurring problem which remains unsolved is\\nthat of Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). While the issue has been extensively\\nstudied empirically, little attention has been paid from a theoretical angle.\\nIn this paper, we show that the impact of CF increases as two tasks\\nincreasingly align. We introduce a measure of task similarity called the NTK\\noverlap matrix which is at the core of CF. We analyze common projected gradient\\nalgorithms and demonstrate how they mitigate forgetting. Then, we propose a\\nvariant of Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) which leverages structure of the\\ndata through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experiments support our\\ntheoretical findings and show how our method can help reduce CF on classical CL\\ndatasets.\",\n          \"Few-shot learning is a challenging task since only few instances are given\\nfor recognizing an unseen class. One way to alleviate this problem is to\\nacquire a strong inductive bias via meta-learning on similar tasks. In this\\npaper, we show that such inductive bias can be learned from a flat collection\\nof unlabeled images, and instantiated as transferable representations among\\nseen and unseen classes. Specifically, we propose a novel part-based\\nself-supervised representation learning scheme to learn transferable\\nrepresentations by maximizing the similarity of an image to its discriminative\\npart. To mitigate the overfitting in few-shot classification caused by data\\nscarcity, we further propose a part augmentation strategy by retrieving extra\\nimages from a base dataset. We conduct systematic studies on miniImageNet and\\ntieredImageNet benchmarks. Remarkably, our method yields impressive results,\\noutperforming the previous best unsupervised methods by 7.74% and 9.24% under\\n5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings, which are comparable with\\nstate-of-the-art supervised methods.\",\n          \"Surgical instrument segmentation is extremely important for computer-assisted\\nsurgery. Different from common object segmentation, it is more challenging due\\nto the large illumination and scale variation caused by the special surgical\\nscenes. In this paper, we propose a novel bilinear attention network with\\nadaptive receptive field to solve these two challenges. For the illumination\\nvariation, the bilinear attention module can capture second-order statistics to\\nencode global contexts and semantic dependencies between local pixels. With\\nthem, semantic features in challenging areas can be inferred from their\\nneighbors and the distinction of various semantics can be boosted. For the\\nscale variation, our adaptive receptive field module aggregates multi-scale\\nfeatures and automatically fuses them with different weights. Specifically, it\\nencodes the semantic relationship between channels to emphasize feature maps\\nwith appropriate scales, changing the receptive field of subsequent\\nconvolutions. The proposed network achieves the best performance 97.47% mean\\nIOU on Cata7 and comes first place on EndoVis 2017 by 10.10% IOU overtaking\\nsecond-ranking method.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"terms\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3157,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['cs.LG', 'cs.CE', 'q-fin.ST', 'stat.ML']\",\n          \"['cs.LG', 'physics.comp-ph', 'physics.flu-dyn']\",\n          \"['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'math.AT']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Although major advances\\nhave been made in the field, one recurring problem which remains unsolved is\\nthat of Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). While the issue has been extensively\\nstudied empirically, little attention has been paid from a theoretical angle.\\nIn this paper, we show that the impact of CF increases as two tasks\\nincreasingly align. We introduce a measure of task similarity called the NTK\\noverlap matrix which is at the core of CF. We analyze common projected gradient\\nalgorithms and demonstrate how they mitigate forgetting. Then, we propose a\\nvariant of Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) which leverages structure of the\\ndata through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experiments support our\\ntheoretical findings and show how our method can help reduce CF on classical CL\\ndatasets.\",\n          \"Few-shot learning is a challenging task since only few instances are given\\nfor recognizing an unseen class. One way to alleviate this problem is to\\nacquire a strong inductive bias via meta-learning on similar tasks. In this\\npaper, we show that such inductive bias can be learned from a flat collection\\nof unlabeled images, and instantiated as transferable representations among\\nseen and unseen classes. Specifically, we propose a novel part-based\\nself-supervised representation learning scheme to learn transferable\\nrepresentations by maximizing the similarity of an image to its discriminative\\npart. To mitigate the overfitting in few-shot classification caused by data\\nscarcity, we further propose a part augmentation strategy by retrieving extra\\nimages from a base dataset. We conduct systematic studies on miniImageNet and\\ntieredImageNet benchmarks. Remarkably, our method yields impressive results,\\noutperforming the previous best unsupervised methods by 7.74% and 9.24% under\\n5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings, which are comparable with\\nstate-of-the-art supervised methods.\",\n          \"Surgical instrument segmentation is extremely important for computer-assisted\\nsurgery. Different from common object segmentation, it is more challenging due\\nto the large illumination and scale variation caused by the special surgical\\nscenes. In this paper, we propose a novel bilinear attention network with\\nadaptive receptive field to solve these two challenges. For the illumination\\nvariation, the bilinear attention module can capture second-order statistics to\\nencode global contexts and semantic dependencies between local pixels. With\\nthem, semantic features in challenging areas can be inferred from their\\nneighbors and the distinction of various semantics can be boosted. For the\\nscale variation, our adaptive receptive field module aggregates multi-scale\\nfeatures and automatically fuses them with different weights. Specifically, it\\nencodes the semantic relationship between channels to emphasize feature maps\\nwith appropriate scales, changing the receptive field of subsequent\\nconvolutions. The proposed network achieves the best performance 97.47% mean\\nIOU on Cata7 and comes first place on EndoVis 2017 by 10.10% IOU overtaking\\nsecond-ranking method.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"terms\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3157,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['cs.LG', 'cs.CE', 'q-fin.ST', 'stat.ML']\",\n          \"['cs.LG', 'physics.comp-ph', 'physics.flu-dyn']\",\n          \"['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'math.AT']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A crucial\\nstep of MS data processing is the peak picking which selects peaks containing\\ninformation about molecules with high concentrations which are of interest in\\nan MS investigation. We present a new procedure of the peak picking based on a\\nsparse coding algorithm. Given a set of spectra of different classes, i.e. with\\ndifferent positions and heights of the peaks, this procedure can extract peaks\\nby means of unsupervised learning. Instead of an $l_1$-regularization penalty\\nterm used in the original sparse coding algorithm we propose using an\\nelastic-net penalty term for better regularization. The evaluation is done by\\nmeans of simulation.

On both fixed allele (Nielsen and Lund 2009) and pan-allele (Nielsen\\net.al. 2010) benchmark databases, our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art\\nperformance.

              "'Paper title: CAMul: Calibrated and Accurate Multi-view Time-Series Forecasting\\nMain contribution: Probabilistic time-series forecasting enables reliable decision making across\\nmany domains. Most forecasting problems have diverse sources of data containing\\nmultiple modalities and structures. Leveraging information as well as\\nuncertainty from these data sources for well-calibrated and accurate forecasts\\nis an important challenging problem. Most previous work on multi-modal learning\\nand forecasting simply aggregate intermediate representations from each data\\nview by simple methods of summation or concatenation and do not explicitly\\nmodel uncertainty for each data-view. We propose a general probabilistic\\nmulti-view forecasting framework CAMul, that can learn representations and\\nuncertainty from diverse data sources. It integrates the knowledge and\\nuncertainty from each data view in a dynamic context-specific manner assigning\\nmore importance to useful views to model a well-calibrated forecast\\ndistribution. We use CAMul for multiple domains with varied sources and\\nmodalities and show that CAMul outperforms other state-of-art probabilistic\\nforecasting models by over 25\\\\% in accuracy and calibration.'"
